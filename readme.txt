Then there are functions for different algorithms
A*
Greedy
UCS
BFS
DFS
DLS
IDS

The DLS asks for user input for the depth limit

There are helper functions to perform sorting, calculate heuristics, and check for moves


Example to run the code:
this will generate a dump file
python expense_8_puzzle.py start.txt goal.txt a* true

this will not generate a dump file
python expense_8_puzzle.py start.txt goal.txt ids
